<p>Five Fun Things was inspired by article in Private Eye. The premise 
was rather than worry about eating <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day-what-counts/">5 veg and fruit a day</a>, its better to do five fun things a day. 
<a href="https://www.subscription.co.uk/private-eye/store/subscription">Plug for Private Eye</a></p>

every day. With helpful reminders to make this a habit. </p>
